# Count-pairs-with-given-sum

## Difficulty: Medium
Given an array arr, and an integer k, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is k.

Examples:

Input: k = 6, arr[] = [1, 5, 7, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.
Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each 1 will produce sum 2 with any 1.
Input: k = 2, arr[] = [4, 12, 5, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 0 pairs with sum 2.
